*page_break The Saint Dymphna’s Asylum Massacre

*label prologue

[b]The Mirrored Hour[/b]

The flicker of the overhead lights was the first sign that something was wrong.

Nurse Evangeline adjusted the IV drip for the patient in room 17, her hands steady despite the creeping chill crawling up her spine. 
The antiseptic scent of [i]Saint Dymphna Asylum[/i] was a strange comfort, a sterile shield against the chaos she knew awaited beyond these walls. 
But tonight, even that sharp, clean smell seemed to carry a hint of rot—something [i]sour[/i] lurking beneath the surface.

She paused before stepping out of the room to [i]gently[/i] tuck the patient's blanket beneath his chin. "Warm enough, Mr. Halvorsen?" she asked [i]softly[/i]. 
His eyes fluttered open, cloudy but calm, and he managed a faint nod. She gave him a smile—one of those real, weary ones, full of quiet understanding. 
[i]"I'll check on you again before shift change, alright?"[/i]

The corridor stretched ahead, long and silent but for the faintest [i]hum[/i] beneath her boots. 
It was subtle at first, easy to mistake for the building’s old plumbing or the restless stirrings of the patients. 
But as she moved, the hum deepened, growing louder, a vibration that prickled her skin and sent a cold shiver darting through her nerves.

Rooms 18 and 19 lay ahead, their doors cracked open, spilling weak light into the hallway. 
Evangeline paused by [i]room 18[/i], where a man with wild eyes stared at the ceiling, lips moving in silent prayer or perhaps desperate [i]madness[/i]. 
She swallowed hard and forced herself onward.

But not before stepping inside and gently refilling the man's water cup, brushing back the damp curls from his forehead. 
"Shh, Isaiah," she murmured, kneeling beside him. "You're safe. It's just the storm outside." 
Her voice was soft, patient—the same one she'd used for [i]her son[/i] when he was afraid of thunder. 
For a moment, the man's lips stopped moving, and he blinked at her as if truly seeing her. Then, just as quickly, [i]the panic[/i] returned. 
Still, she let him hold her hand for a heartbeat longer before slipping away.
*page_break Next

She reached the nurses' station and tapped the old landline — [i]no signal[/i]. The static buzzed in her ear like insects. 
Frowning, she checked the monitors—several of them had gone dark, just black screens with blinking cursors.

“You’re alright, Eva,” she whispered to herself. “It’s just another power surge.” But her hands trembled slightly. 
Not from fear of the dark—but from what it [i]reminded[/i] her of. The basement. The broken bulb in the hallway. 
The way he used to stand just outside the reach of the light so she couldn’t see his face when he said those [i]awful[/i] things.

Her heart hammered, not just from the growing unease in the asylum, 
but from a memory she fought to suppress—the way her ex had cornered her in a room just like this, [i]the cold anger[/i] in his voice, 
the desperation that had spilled into [i]violence[/i]. She squeezed her fists, willing those ghosts to stay buried.

She was no stranger to pain—too well acquainted with it, in fact. 
[i]The bruises[/i] hidden beneath her sleeves, the late nights spent tiptoeing around sleeping children, 
the quiet phone calls from a lawyer about custody battles and restraining orders. Her past wasn’t just a shadow; it was [i]a weight[/i] she carried every day. 
Years ago, she had fled a man whose love had turned to violence, leaving behind broken promises and shattered trust. 
Her two children, the only [i]light[/i] in her fractured world, were her reason to keep going—even when the darkness inside threatened to [i]consume[/i] her.

Tonight, the asylum’s creeping dread was different, but it whispered the same message: [i]some nightmares don’t end when the sun rises[/i].

[i]"Evangeline?"[/i]
*page_break Next

The voice came from behind her—gentle, uncertain.

Camila stood in the doorway of the common room, clutching a worn clipboard to her chest. Young, bright-eyed, too soft for this job. 
She reminded Evangeline of her daughter at seventeen—full of questions and afraid to ask any of them.

"Scanner’s dead again," Camila muttered, cheeks flushed. "And I think these doses are logged wrong. I—I don’t want to mess anything up."

Evangeline offered a small, warm smile. She always made time for [i]kindness[/i]. Even when she had nothing left to give. “You didn’t mess up. Come here.”

She scanned the log with a practiced eye, fingers brushing Camila’s hand—firm, steady, [i]motherly[/i]. “It’s just a mislabel. Easy fix.”

Camila let out a breath. “You’re always so calm.”

“Not calm,” Evangeline said softly, lips tilting into a tired smirk. [i]“Just too old to panic.”[/i]

The joke didn’t land, not fully. But Camila smiled anyway, the tension easing from her shoulders.

“Go check Room 12 for me, would you?” Evangeline said. “Double-check the chart. Take a moment. [i]Breathe.[/i]”

Camila nodded and turned to go. Evangeline watched her retreating figure and thought—not for the first time—that she hoped the girl would get out of here. 
Leave this job. Leave this [i]place[/i]. Before it hollowed her out the way it had hollowed so many.

A dull ache pressed behind her ribs, sudden and sharp. She thought of her daughter again—[i]Cecilia[/i], bright, stubborn Cecilia — 
halfway across the country now with a child of her own and a night shift at a battered women’s shelter. 
They hadn’t spoken in months. Not because of hate, just... [i]exhaustion[/i]. Too many apologies left unsaid. Too much love tangled in old wounds.

But she was trying. God, she was trying.

Sometimes, Evangeline would catch herself writing letters to her that she never sent. Notes about nothing in particular. A good soup recipe. 
A funny patient quote. A half-remembered lullaby. She kept them folded in her coat pocket like talismans. 
Proof she was still [i]a mother[/i], even at the end of the line.

And her son, still too young to understand why his mother always came home with eyes too tired to cry.

Her heart stung. She turned back to the hallway.
*page_break Next

As she passed room 19, a sudden noise—a faint scrape against the floor—made her [i]flinch[/i]. Her breath caught. 
It was the kind of sudden, sharp sound that could unspool the fragile calm she’d fought to build, 
the same [i]panic[/i] she felt when she heard footsteps behind her in dark hallways long ago. 
She closed her eyes briefly, drawing in a shaky breath, thinking of her children waiting at home, safe—or so she hoped.

The dim light above flickered again, and Evangeline’s mind flashed to another memory: 
the bruises she’d hidden from the world, [i]the promises[/i] she’d made to herself to never go back, the small voice inside that told her she was worth [i]more[/i]. 
Yet here, in these endless halls, that voice felt faint—like it was being swallowed by the cold, sterile walls.

She pressed her palm to the wall for support, feeling the rough texture beneath her fingers, [i]grounding[/i] herself. 
Every step forward was a battle—not just against the creeping fear in the asylum, but the haunting past that clung to her like a second skin.

A sudden echo of a shout, distant but sharp, jolted her. 
Her heart raced, not just from the sound but from the memory it stirred—the night she had fled, the frantic packing, the locked door, 
and the shattering crash behind her as he tried to [i]break in[/i]. She swallowed hard, fighting back the tremor in her hands.

The lights flickered again. A long, low groan echoed through the building, almost like the sound of metal warping under pressure.

Then, [i]a scream[/i].

Short. Cut off.

Evangeline didn’t hesitate. She was already moving, shoes squeaking faintly against the linoleum, past room 20, then 21. 
The scream hadn’t been loud—but she [i]knew[/i] her patients. Knew their voices, their silences, their suffering. 
And she couldn’t—[i]not ever[/i]—ignore a cry like that.

She remembered how her daughter used to scream like that in the night, back when they lived in [i]the shelter[/i]. 
She’d hold her close, rub her back in slow circles, whisper stories of quiet forests and safe cabins with warm soup waiting inside. 
She never wanted anyone—[i]anyone[/i]—to feel as alone as her baby did then.

The humming deepened. It was beneath her skin now, crawling up her spine like fingers pressing bone.

Her footsteps echoed softly, but behind them, something else stirred. 
A low murmur, a whispering at the edges of hearing, like voices just beyond comprehension. She stopped, heart skipping. 
The asylum was old, its walls soaked with the memories of pain and madness—but this was [i]different[/i].

There was a coldness here that wasn’t just the night air seeping through cracks. It was something older, [i]deeper[/i]. 
Something that promised pain far worse than any she’d known before.

And yet, she had to keep moving. For them. For the fragile hope that somewhere beyond this night, a future waited.

The radio at the nurse’s station crackled, and for a moment, static was all she heard. 
Then came the broken words: [i]“Code Grey Echo… lockdown breach… containment failure…”[/i]

She rounded the corner—
*page_break And stopped

Her breath caught in her throat.

She quickened her pace, fingers trembling as she gripped the railing. Down the hall, a flicker of movement—shadow stretching, twisting unnaturally. 
Patients in room 22 banged their fists against the walls, screaming in a language she couldn’t understand, voices layered with something… [i]foreign[/i].

The hum became a pulse, slow and heavy, like a heartbeat buried beneath stone.

Evangeline’s pulse quickened in response.
Then came the screams

A sharp, ragged sound that tore through the corridors like glass shattering. The cries of the frightened, the injured, the lost. 
They spilled from the east wing, near the delivery ward, where new lives should be greeted with hope, not terror.

[i]“God, no—”[/i] she whispered, already moving.

She ran.

Her shoes slapped against cracked tiles, the air thick with dust and the metallic tang of blood. Her breath came in ragged gasps. 
The world around her seemed to narrow to a pinprick of light and sound—a tightrope stretched over an abyss.

A door creaked open, and she glimpsed the source of the screams. Nurses and doctors were scattering, faces pale, eyes wide with [i]horror[/i]. 
Patients writhed on the floor, some convulsing violently, others silent, their eyes empty.

She reached out to steady a young woman collapsing near the nurses’ station, but the touch burned cold—like [i]ice[/i] sliding beneath her skin.

Lights flickered violently. Shadows danced on the walls, growing longer, twisting into grotesque shapes that seemed almost alive. 
The hum became a roar, a wave crashing over the asylum’s fractured bones.
*page_break Next

Time [i]fractured[/i]. Moments stretched and folded over themselves, slipping like water through her fingers. 
She clutched the wall for balance, nausea twisting her stomach. Her mind reeled—past and present blending, memories bleeding through like light through gauze.

She saw herself at [i]seven[/i], huddled in a locked closet while her father kicked down the kitchen door. She was [i]seventeen[/i] again, 
biting her lip to stay quiet as her husband punched a hole through the plaster two inches from her head. 
Then she was [i]twenty-five[/i], in the dark of a silent bedroom, whispering lullabies to a baby she could no longer afford to feed.

The echo in the air wasn’t just the asylum breaking—it was her, breaking with it.

Time fractured. Moments stretched and folded over themselves, slipping like water through her fingers.

She caught her reflection in a shattered window—her eyes wild, mouth parted in a silent scream, hands trembling.

And in the flicker of broken glass, she saw another face.

A patient. [i]Elsie.[/i]

Elsie, who hummed to herself like a wind-up toy. Who had come close to ending her life three times that year alone. 
Who trusted Evangeline enough to let her braid her hair. She was still there—huddled against the far wall, shaking violently. 
The world was coming undone, and she was just a girl again. A [i]terrified[/i] girl trapped in her own head.
*page_break Evangeline didn’t hesitate

She bolted toward her, dodging a nurse being thrown against the wall by an unseen force. Blood streaked the tiles. 
A man in a lab coat screamed as the lights above burst in showers of glass and sparks. 
Evangeline threw herself down beside Elsie and pulled her close, [i]shielding her[/i] with her own body.

“I’ve got you,” she whispered, voice cracking. “I’ve got you, [i]sweet girl[/i].”

Elsie sobbed against her chest, clinging like a child. 
Her fingernails dug into Evangeline’s uniform, trembling hands wrapped in fistfuls of fabric, as if letting go meant being swallowed whole. 
The air crackled around them, thick with something not entirely [i]human[/i]. 
Not quite heat, not quite light—more like the pressure before a scream, a storm curled inside the lungs of the world.

Behind them, the hallway had begun to peel. Not physically—yet—but perceptibly, like wallpaper soaked in gasoline, blistering at the edges. 
The shadows were no longer content to linger; they reached now, curling up the walls like fingers.

The corridor convulsed. The lights [i]flared[/i] violently, strobing between too-bright and pitch-black. 
Walls seemed to breathe, bulging outward like something beneath them was trying to get free.

Camila stumbled into view from the far corridor, one arm cradling her ribs, the other slick with [i]blood[/i]. 
Her eyes locked on Evangeline’s—wide, terrified, pleading.
Without a word, Eva reached out, catching her wrist and pulling her down into the small shelter of her body, wrapping both girls in her arms.
Camila didn’t speak. She just pressed her forehead to Evangeline’s shoulder, [i]shaking[/i] like a leaf.
*page_break And then, the world exploded

A pulse tore through the asylum—a soundless quake that rattled through her bones. Lights shattered in a cascade of sparks. 
Doors unhinged, windows burst inward, glass raining like knives.

Then a burst of blinding light tore through the building, ripping flesh from bone, hope from despair. 
Reality split at the seams—doors flew from hinges, metal screamed, the floor cracked like old ice.

From the east wing came a scream—a different one. New. Fragile. [i]A baby's cry.[/i]

Eva froze.

She was nowhere near the delivery ward. She hadn’t been there all night. 
But she felt it—like a thread pulled tight through her soul, the unmistakable cry of life announcing itself in the middle of death.

The hum surged to a roar. The air folded in on itself. Elsie screamed. 
Camila clutched her tighter, whispering a name—maybe a prayer, maybe just the sound of fear [i]unraveling[/i].

Evangeline turned toward the sound—toward the baby she couldn’t see, couldn’t reach—and she prayed.

Not for herself. 
*page_break Not anymore

But for them. For [i]the survivors[/i]. For the one who had just entered this nightmare in a cradle of blood and fire.

A burst of blinding light tore through the asylum.

Flesh from bone. Hope from despair. Past from future.

Evangeline felt her body [i]shatter[/i] under the force, [i]pain blooming like fire[/i], consuming everything. 
She felt her body give way to heat, the agony shooting molten lava throughout her entire chest and limbs, searing down to the marrow.

She thought of Elsie—[i]fragile, terrified Elsie[/i]—and wondered if she had enough strength to shield her from what came next. 
She thought of her own daughter and son, their tiny hands and [i]gap-toothed smiles[/i], and the lullabies she used to hum while hiding bruises under her sleeves.

And still—

Still—

That cry.

[i]That newness.[/i]

That impossible, sacred defiance of the end.

She didn’t know whose child it was. She didn’t know if the mother had survived, or if the child would. 
But she felt the thread tether between them, bright and unbroken, even as her own [i]frayed[/i] to nothing.

[i]Let them live[/i], she thought.

Let them carry the light I couldn’t.

Let something come from this that isn’t horror.

And as her vision dissolved into white, and her soul unraveled like a ribbon, she let go — 
folding herself into that infant’s first breath, echoing forever in the shadows of [i]Saint Dymphna[/i].
*page_break The End... For Now...

[i]That’s where we leave it—for now.[/i]

A heartbeat suspended in the dark.

But the story is still breathing. Beneath the rubble of Saint Dymphna, beneath the silence and smoke, it waits. 
I’m already tracing its next pulse—listening for echoes, peeling back memory, following the tremors where truth still hides.

If something stayed with you—a breath Evangeline never got to take, a flicker of light in the hospital’s corridors, a cry you could almost hear in the dark—
I would be honored to know.

Your thoughts, your questions, your presence… they shape the way forward.

Thank you for stepping into this with me.
Thank you for feeling the weight of it.
And thank you for holding space for softness, even in the aftermath of fire.

We’ll return.
There’s still more to remember.

[i]Yours in the dark,

Audrine[/i]
